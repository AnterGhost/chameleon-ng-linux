# chameleon-ng

chameleon-ng is an extended version of the [Chameleon](https://github.com/aixxe/Chameleon) project, an internal skin & knife changer for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Like the original project, the code contains extensive comments intended for those new to game manipulation.

* Allows usage of skins on any weapon without restrictions.
* Includes primitive fix for special knife animations.
* Network variable offsets are retrieved at runtime.
* Ability to override weapon kill feed icons.
* Full in-game graphical configuration.
